       "'Why did I go to see this film? Honestly, because Jim Carrey was in it and in the past he has made hilarious movies that have made me cry with laughter, so do you really blame me for expecting that again? Additionally, the premise, the funny trailer, his co-star Jennifer Aniston\\'s involvement, and the fact it was a massive hit stateside encouraged me.<br /><br />However, as my \"one line Summary\" suggests, I was Disappointed. For various reasons;<br /><br />Reason 1: It wasn\\'t funny. In a 2hour movie, I laughed for about 5-10minutes...all together, the rest of the time I sat thinking \"I really should have got some ice-cream\". I admit that maybe it is wrong to judge Jim Carrey on his previous films, but what does he really expect when he makes Gem\\'s such as \\'The Truman Show\\' , \\'Liar Liar\\' , \\'Me, Myself and Irene\\' , \\'Dumb and Dumber\\' , \\'The Mask\\', and the \\'Ace Ventura\\' films then produces, in Bruce Nolan\\'s own words, such a mediocre film?<br /><br />Reason 2: Jennifer Aniston\\'s role was criminally underwritten. I mean hello! She\\'s been around in the public eye for about ten years now, and in this film she gets about four lines to say. Wrong.<br /><br />Reason 3: One word - Cliché<br /><br />Reason 4: A casual deployment of specifically American References - Jimmy Hoffa, Walter Cronkite \\'sweeps week\\' - is a clue to the film\\'s specifically home-grown appeal. \"A teenager says no to drugs and yes to an Education - that\\'s a miracle! Want to see a miracle soon? Be the miracle!\" God tells Bruce, a heavy handed sentiment that seems to have gone down a treat in the US, but might face tougher resistance in markets that retain an inkling for subtlety. Additionally, I still go to school, and that statement suggests me and all of my friend\\'s are miracles...or maybe it just means we have brains?<br /><br />In this film there are enough funny Carrey moments to make you chuckle and prevent Bruce Almighty from being a total calamity, but you are advised to start revising your expectations downwards.'"
