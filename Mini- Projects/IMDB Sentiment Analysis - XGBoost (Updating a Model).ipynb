In particular, we will look at the XGBoost sentiment analysis model that we constructed earlier. In this case, however, we have some new data that our model doesn't seem to perform very well on. As a result, we will re-train our model and update an existing endpoint so that it uses our new model.\n",

Instructions will be provided for each section and the specifics of the implementation are marked in the code block with a `# TODO: ...` comment. Please be sure to read the instructions carefully!\n",
